"""
Regression lock for TD-105's fix: whatsapp's test_anomaly_flag arm now
recomputes web-check accessibility from raw $.requests[] instead of
trusting the probe-submitted whatsapp_web_status field, which an
eight-check verification session (2026-08-21) found unreliable
specifically at probe test_version=0.9.0 -- that probe version's own
plain-HTTP check against http://web.whatsapp.com/ marks the whole web
check "failed" whenever the response isn't exactly HTTP 302, regardless
of whether the HTTPS leg of the same URL succeeded, and OONI's own
backend scorer never reads this field at all. Probe 0.11.0 removes the
flawed check entirely.

THIS TEST EXISTS SPECIFICALLY TO STOP A FUTURE REFACTOR FROM SILENTLY
WIDENING THIS FIX INTO BUG (b)/(c)'S TERRITORY. The same verification
session investigated two other conditions in whatsapp's OR-chain --
whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count > 0 (real, but heterogeneous: a small
oracle check split roughly 50/50 against OONI's own judgment) and
registration_server_status = 'blocked' (89% genuinely correct across
both probe versions) -- and found neither shares bug (a)'s shape.
Folding either into this fix, or "cleaning up" the OR-chain while in
this file, was explicitly out of scope. If a future edit changes any of
the OTHER four OR-chain conditions, or the NULL-check branch, this
file's static assertions must fail.

UPDATE (TD-105 build, 2026-08-22): bug (b) (whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_
count > 0 and the always-dead whatsapp_endpoints_dns_inconsistent_count
> 0) received its own dedicated investigation and was found actively
wrong (OONI's own scorer disables this exact rule in source, and two
independent samples found 0/131 agreement once isolated from bug (a)/(c)
as a confound) -- see tests/test_ooni_whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count_
removed.py for that fix's own regression lock. This file's static
assertion below is updated accordingly: it now asserts the whatsapp
OR-chain has exactly THREE conditions (whatsapp_endpoints_status,
whatsapp_web_accessible, registration_server_status), not five --
bug (b)'s two conditions are asserted ABSENT, not present. Bug (c)
(registration_server_status) remains untouched and is still guarded
here.

UPDATE (TD-126, 2026-08-30): bug (c) (registration_server_status) is no
longer untouched -- see tests/test_ooni_whatsapp_registration_accessible_
classification.py for that fix's own dedicated regression lock, mirroring
this file's own structure. This file's `test_whatsapp_other_orchain_
conditions_untouched` and `test_live_no_row_with_other_driver_true_is_
missing_anomalous` are updated in the same TD-126 build session to assert
the new OR-chain shape instead of the old one -- they still guard against
this fix's own scope (whatsapp_web_accessible, whatsapp_endpoints_status)
drifting, just no longer against bug (c) changing, since bug (c) changing
in this specific, characterized way is now the correct state. Neither
this file's own pinned fixture needed new entries: none of its pinned
measurement_ids happen to be one of the 2 rows TD-126 reclassifies.

Two layers of protection, same pattern as
tests/test_ooni_dnscheck_bootstrap_failed_classification.py:

1. Static SQL-text assertions (always run, zero credentials). Checks
   that the whatsapp OR-chain's web-check condition now reads
   whatsapp_web_accessible IS FALSE (not whatsapp_web_status = 'blocked'),
   that the other four conditions and the NULL-check branch are
   byte-for-byte unchanged, and that whatsapp_web_accessible's extraction
   exists in staging.

2. Live-BigQuery behavioral assertions, gated behind RUN_BIGQUERY_TESTS=1.
   Unlike dnscheck (TD-103: confirmed-degenerate oracle), whatsapp has a
   valid, non-degenerate oracle -- OONI's own /api/v1/measurements is used
   as ground truth for the pinned fixture's bug-(a)-related rows and the
   registration-server regression guard. ONE fixture row (the bug-(b)
   guard) deliberately uses CLIO's own OR-chain logic as ground truth
   instead, per that row's own note in the fixture file -- see
   tests/fixtures/ooni_whatsapp_web_accessible_classification/
   pinned_measurements.json's top-level _comment for why.

PINNED FIXTURE (tests/fixtures/ooni_whatsapp_web_accessible_classification/
pinned_measurements.json): 8 real measurement_ids -- 2 reclassified
(test_version=0.9.0, ANOMALOUS->OK), 2 regression guards proving a
second real driver keeps a 0.9.0 row ANOMALOUS despite the web-check fix,
2 regression guards at test_version=0.11.0 (already correct, provably
unchanged), and one guard each for bug (c) and bug (b) proving those
conditions are untouched.
