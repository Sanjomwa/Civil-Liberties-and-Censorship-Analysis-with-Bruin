"""
Regression lock for TD-105's build fix: whatsapp's test_anomaly_flag arm
no longer treats whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count > 0 or
whatsapp_endpoints_dns_inconsistent_count > 0 as ANOMALOUS drivers --
both conditions are REMOVED from the OR-chain, not thresholded.

Two verification sessions (2026-08-21, 2026-08-22) found
whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count > 0 actively wrong, not just imprecise:
OONI's own live scorer source contains this exact rule, commented out,
with the note "Disabled due to bug in the probe
https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/issues/341". Restricted to the
population where blocked_count was the ONLY driver (no co-occurring
web-check or registration failure), OONI's real classification agreed
with CLIO's ANOMALOUS call 0/131 times across two independently-drawn
samples, spanning the full blocked_count range (1-15) and every
magnitude bucket. The earlier-observed "high count usually means real
interference" pattern was a confound: high-blocked_count rows are
disproportionately ones where a web or registration failure ALSO
occurred (only 18.4% of the highest bucket is actually isolated from
that), and OONI's own scorer never reaches its endpoint-accessibility
check at all once the web/registration checks have already failed --
confirmed directly via OONI's `scores.analysis` sub-object, present only
when that branch is reached.

whatsapp_endpoints_dns_inconsistent_count > 0 is removed alongside it as
dead weight, not on its own merits: confirmed permanently 0/51,394 rows
live, never populated by the probe.

UPDATE (TD-126, 2026-08-30): the third surviving condition this file
guards (registration_server_status = 'blocked') was itself repointed to
whatsapp_registration_accessible IS FALSE -- see
tests/test_ooni_whatsapp_registration_accessible_classification.py for
that fix's own dedicated regression lock. This file's
`test_whatsapp_orchain_surviving_conditions_unchanged` and
`test_live_no_row_with_independent_driver_true_is_missing_anomalous` are
updated in the same TD-126 build session to assert the new shape.

THIS TEST EXISTS SPECIFICALLY TO STOP A FUTURE REFACTOR FROM SILENTLY
REINTRODUCING EITHER CONDITION, THRESHOLDED OR OTHERWISE. If a future
edit adds any severity-aware logic keyed on whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_
count back into the OR-chain, that is a design decision that needs its
own fresh evidence -- this test's static assertions must fail to force
that conversation, not silently pass.

Two layers of protection, same pattern as
tests/test_ooni_whatsapp_web_accessible_classification.py:

1. Static SQL-text assertions (always run, zero credentials). Checks
   that both conditions are ABSENT from the whatsapp OR-chain, and that
   the three surviving conditions are present, unchanged.

2. Live-BigQuery behavioral assertions, gated behind RUN_BIGQUERY_TESTS=1.
   whatsapp has a valid, non-degenerate oracle (OONI's own
   /api/v1/measurements), confirmed by two verification sessions -- used
   as ground truth throughout.

PINNED FIXTURE (tests/fixtures/ooni_whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count_removed/
pinned_measurements.json): 5 real measurement_ids -- 2 reclassified
(low and highest-observed blocked_count buckets, ANOMALOUS->OK), 2
regression guards proving a second real driver (whatsapp_web_accessible,
registration_server_status) keeps a row ANOMALOUS despite the removal,
and 1 guard for an already-OK row never touched by blocked_count at all.
