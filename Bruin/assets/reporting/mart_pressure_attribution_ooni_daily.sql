  Pressure-attribution decomposition, OONI corroboration layer (ADR-0006;
  fulfills Project Zero Review Recommendation #4).

  GRAIN: one row per measurement_date x test_name x protocol -- the daily
  per-app, per-protocol-layer view of what OONI probes directly observed.

  THIS IS CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, NOT A COMPOSITE INPUT -- stated here
  because it is the single easiest thing to misread about CLIO's headline
  number: OONI measurement does NOT feed composite_pressure_score
  arithmetically (verified directly against
  marts.fact_country_pressure_daily for ADR-0006; the composite's
  "platform" term is Google Transparency data, not OONI). What OONI
  provides for an attributed finding is independent, same-day,
  network-layer measurement: whether the apps and protocols civil
  society relies on were measurably interfered with on the date in
  question. It corroborates (or fails to corroborate) a conflict-driven
  reading; it never moves the score.

  test_name is kept as a grouping key deliberately -- do NOT pool
  test families into one share. dnscheck's recovered volume (TD-47) is
  structurally zero-signal today (TD-55) and pooling it into a shared
  denominator dilutes real app-blocking shares (TD-54's measured
  finding, now TD-49's standing requirement). Per-test_name rows keep
  every rate honest: a dnscheck row's rate is dnscheck's own, never
  blended into WhatsApp's.

  Confidence labels come from marts.dim_censorship_confidence via the
  same min_score threshold join canonicalized by ADR-0001 (identical
  pattern to marts.fact_protocol_blocking_summary, which is this asset's
  monthly counterpart -- kept structurally parallel on purpose).

      TD-95 Phase 0: whether this row's OONI reading is network-path-
      confirmed or probe-vantage-point-only. Every row today reads
      'VANTAGE_ONLY' -- CLIO attributes findings to Kenya from probe
      location alone, with no cross-ASN concordance or out-of-country
      vantage points to distinguish upstream/transit/destination-side
      interference from in-country blocking (that data does not exist
      yet; it is TD-95 Phases 1-3, not this column). This field exists
      so the limitation is queryable, not to encode a distinction the
      evidence cannot yet support.
