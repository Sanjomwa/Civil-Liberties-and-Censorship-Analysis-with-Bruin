  TD-87 Phase 1 (2026-08-15). Surfaces each OONI test's own summary verdict
  fields (the field the probe itself computes and submits) as typed
  nullable columns. Grain: one row per measurement_id, 1:1 with
  stg.ooni_measurements (this is a wide SELECT, not a filter -- every
  measurement gets a row here regardless of test_name).

  This is strictly additive and has NO CONSUMER YET as of this commit --
  int.ooni_experiment_results.sql, result_state, and every existing
  downstream mart/Streamlit page are untouched. See
  int.ooni_measurement_verdicts.sql (Phase 2) for the first consumer.

  Field vocabulary verified live against Kenya's actual corpus before
  writing this SQL (TD-87 Phase 1/2 relay session, 2026-08-15), not
  assumed -- see reports.md for the full sampling methodology. Real
  findings that changed this asset from the original design hypothesis:

  - Only 6 test_name values exist in CLIO's entire ingested corpus:
    dnscheck, whatsapp, telegram, psiphon, signal, tor. web_connectivity
    and facebook_messenger have ZERO rows -- confirmed absent from both
    this staging layer and the raw landing table
    (civil_liberties_staging.ooni_measurements), not a filtering
    artifact. Their columns below (wc_*, facebook_*) are built for
    structural/forward-compatibility reasons (the CONFIRMED verdict
    concept in Phase 2 is deliberately web_connectivity-only) and are
    verified against OONI's own published spec
    (ooni/spec ts-017-web-connectivity.md, ts-019-facebook-messenger.md,
    fetched live) rather than CLIO's own data, since none exists yet.
  - signal_backend_status / whatsapp_*_status / telegram_web_status take
    exactly two live values, 'ok' or 'blocked' -- no third value, no NULL,
    confirmed by full GROUP BY across each test's entire corpus.
  - whatsapp_endpoints_blocked / whatsapp_endpoints_dns_inconsistent are
    ARRAYS of endpoint hostnames (e.g. ["e11.whatsapp.net", ...]), not
    booleans as originally hypothesized -- extracted here as integer
    array-length counts (dns_inconsistent is always empty, 0/51,394 rows,
    in live Kenya data; blocked ranges 0-16).
  - telegram_tcp_blocking / telegram_http_blocking ARE real booleans
    ("true"/"false" JSON literals), matching the original hypothesis.
  - psiphon has no test-specific failure field distinct from the generic
    test_keys.failure path -- extracted as psiphon_failure, confirmed
    NOT redundant with the top-level `failure` column (see below).
  - dnscheck: the real signal is the top-level convenience field
    $.bootstrap_failure, NOT the nested $.bootstrap.failure (that nested
    path is 100% NULL in live data despite bootstrap_failure itself being
    populated for ~9.4K/1.1M rows) -- a genuine divergence from a naive
    reading of the JSON shape, caught by checking both paths live.
  - The stg.ooni_measurements.failure column (measurement_failure below)
    is confirmed 100% NULL across all 1,354,848 live rows, all 6 test
    types -- genuinely dead, exactly as flagged before this session.
    ooni_raw.py's `obj.get("failure")` never finds a value in the raw
    JSON OONI actually ships for any test type in this corpus.
  - engine_version does not exist as a field anywhere in the raw JSON
    (checked, always NULL) -- only test_version (already typed on
    stg.ooni_measurements) and software_version (the OONI Probe app
    version, a different concept) exist. test_version is carried through
    below since it is required to join marts.dim_ooni_probe_version_accuracy
    in Phase 2.
  - tor's targets and dnscheck's lookups are both dicts keyed by an
    opaque/URL-shaped key (same blocker as TD-47) -- confirmed live,
    genuinely not extractable via a fixed JSONPath. Neither is attempted
    here, per this phase's explicit scope; dnscheck's bootstrap layer
    (not the per-resolver lookups detail) is still extracted.

  TD-93 (2026-08-15): added signal_legacy_endpoint_nxdomain_only, a new
  boolean column distinguishing NXDOMAIN failures attributable only to a
  legacy/deprecated Signal hostname (per OONI's own current spec) from
  ones corroborated by a real, currently-tested endpoint also failing --
  consumed by int.ooni_measurement_verdicts_candidate.sql to fix a
  substantial Signal ANOMALOUS overcount found via external validation
  against OONI's own real classification. See that asset's header and
  reports.md's 2026-08-15 TD-93 entry for the full finding.

  TD-105 (2026-08-21): added whatsapp_web_accessible, recomputing web-check
  accessibility directly from $.requests[]'s https://web.whatsapp.com/
  entry instead of trusting the probe-submitted whatsapp_web_status field,
  which is unreliable at probe test_version=0.9.0 (a plain-HTTP-leg check
  removed entirely in 0.11.0). whatsapp_web_status/whatsapp_web_failure are
  left in place, untouched, for diagnostic/backward-compatibility value --
  only int.ooni_measurement_verdicts_candidate.sql's whatsapp arm is
  repointed to the new column. See that asset's header and reports.md's
  2026-08-21 TD-105 entry for the full finding, including why bugs (b)
  (whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count) and (c) (registration_server_status)
  were investigated and deliberately left untouched at the time.

  TD-126 (2026-08-30): added whatsapp_registration_accessible, the same
  fix bug (c) above was flagged but never given -- a 2026-08-30
  characterization session (read-only, then a same-day build session)
  found registration_server_status shares TD-105 bug (a)/(b)'s exact
  shape: OONI's own backend fastpath scorer explicitly disables reading
  it, citing the same probe bug already cited for bug (b)
  (ooni/probe-engine#341), and instead recomputes accessibility from
  $.requests[]'s own https://v.whatsapp.net/v2/register entry's failure
  field. Population is small and fully characterized (not estimated): of
  278 registration_server_status='blocked' sole-driver rows, exactly 2
  have a genuinely non-null request failure (both real, matching HTTP 503
  responses from v.whatsapp.net -- transport succeeded, only the probe's
  own higher-level status field disagrees); the other 276 have a real
  transport failure and are unaffected, matching TD-105's own "89%
  genuinely correct" figure for this field. registration_server_status/
  registration_server_failure are left in place, untouched, for
  diagnostic/backward-compatibility value -- same convention as
  whatsapp_web_status/whatsapp_web_failure above; only int.ooni_
  measurement_verdicts_candidate.sql's whatsapp arm is repointed to the
  new column. See that asset's header and reports.md's 2026-08-30 TD-126
  session entries (characterization and build) for the full account.

      TD-91 (2026-08-16), Task E. web_connectivity/facebook_messenger's
      wc_*/facebook_* extraction above was built and verified only
      against OONI's own spec docs (ts-017-web-connectivity.md,
      ts-019-facebook-messenger.md), never against real data -- CLIO's
      corpus has had zero rows of either test type since ingestion began
      (confirmed 2026-08-15, TD-87 Phase 1). This check's own FAILURE
      (either count going nonzero) is itself the actionable signal, not
      a problem to silence: it means one of these test types has started
      arriving for real, and before trusting ANY verdict this asset or
      int.ooni_measurement_verdicts derives for it, re-run the same
      live-sampling verification the 6 real test types got in the
      TD-87 Phase 1 session (per-test-type field presence and real
      values, sampled directly from the new rows) -- do NOT assume the
      spec-derived extraction above is correct until confirmed. Pay
      particular attention to web_connectivity's test_keys.blocking: it
      is polymorphic per OONI's own spec (`optional<string|bool>` -- the
      literal boolean `false` when clean, or one of several strings when
      anomalous), and this asset's wc_blocking extraction has never been
      checked against a real value of either shape.
