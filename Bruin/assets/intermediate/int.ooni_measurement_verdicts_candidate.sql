  TD-91 (2026-08-16): candidate/publish split for the CONFIRMED guard's
  write-order. This asset holds the REAL computation (previously all of
  int.ooni_measurement_verdicts.sql's own body) -- int.ooni_measurement_
  verdicts.sql is now a trivial `SELECT * FROM this table`, published only
  after int.ooni_measurement_verdicts_confirmed_guard.sql passes against
  THIS candidate table, not the already-published one.

  Why: create+replace does not roll back a failed run -- without this
  split, a CONFIRMED-outside-web_connectivity violation would leave a bad
  table live and queryable (by Streamlit or any direct query) for the
  entire window between the violation landing and a fixed rerun
  succeeding. This closes that exposure the same way
  intelligence.acled_pressure_regimes_precondition_check's check-before-
  write pattern does for ACLED.

  Investigated and confirmed cheap before building, not assumed: this
  table and its upstream (stg.ooni_measurement_summary) are both small,
  scalar-only tables (222 MiB / 197 MiB respectively, live-measured via
  __TABLES__) -- nothing like the 63 GiB raw-JSON-carrying
  stg.ooni_measurements this project's 2026-07-06 cost audit flagged as
  the pipeline's actual expensive-rebuild risk. Materializing this
  candidate and then a trivial passthrough copy costs a small fraction of
  a cent at this project's own $6.25/TiB on-demand pricing -- confirmed
  with real byte counts, not the cost audit's own already-expensive OONI
  observation-CTE shape (which reads raw_test_keys directly; this asset
  does not).

  No naming convention for a "_candidate" pattern existed anywhere else
  in this repo before this fix (checked) -- this establishes one.

  Everything below this point (grain, CONFIRMED's structural guard layer
  1, TD-91's psiphon_failure/probe_accuracy_gate corrections) is
  unchanged from the original int.ooni_measurement_verdicts.sql -- see
  reports.md's 2026-08-16 TD-91 session entry for the original TD-87
  Phase 2 design and this session's three corrections.

  TD-93 (2026-08-15): a fourth correction, found via external validation
  against OONI's own real, published per-measurement classification
  (/api/v1/measurements, matched by report_id) rather than CLIO-internal
  sampling. Signal's test_anomaly_flag overcounted ANOMALOUS by routing
  NXDOMAIN failures against two hostnames outside OONI's own current
  ts-029-signal.md spec into ANOMALOUS; OONI's own backend calls these
  FAILED. Fixed via a new signal_legacy_endpoint_nxdomain_only column
  (stg.ooni_measurement_summary.sql) consumed here ahead of test_anomaly_
  flag, same precedence as psiphon_failure. See this file's ooni_verdict
  CASE and reports.md's 2026-08-15 TD-93 entry for the full finding and
  the matched-pair verification (100% substantive agreement, up from
  78.8%, on the same 66-measurement sample TD-91's own investigation
  used).

  OONI's own real, per-measurement verdict vocabulary (OK / CONFIRMED /
  ANOMALOUS / FAILED), derived from each test's own probe-submitted
  summary field (stg.ooni_measurement_summary, Phase 1) -- NOT the same
  thing as result_state, which stays untouched, per-observation, and
  unconsumed by this asset.

  Grain: one row per measurement_id (OONI's own real grain), deliberately
  different from result_state's per-observation grain in
  int.ooni_experiment_results.sql. Consumed only by
  int.ooni_measurement_verdicts_confirmed_guard.sql and the published
  int.ooni_measurement_verdicts -- no existing mart or Streamlit page
  reads this candidate table directly, and none should (query the
  published table instead).

  measurement_failure (sourced from stg.ooni_measurements.failure, the
  raw measurement envelope's top-level `failure` key) is confirmed
  PERMANENTLY dead -- not just currently zero. Verified against OONI's
  own df-000-base.md spec (no top-level `failure` field defined on the
  base measurement envelope at all) and two live raw measurements
  fetched directly from api.ooni.io (a signal and a dnscheck sample, both
  report_id-matched into CLIO's own ingested tables to rule out
  survivorship bias -- both landed with full raw JSON fidelity). This is
  NOT evidence that failed measurements are being dropped before
  ingestion -- every real per-test failure signal lives at a test-
  specific path inside test_keys, which stg.ooni_measurement_summary
  already extracts and this asset already consumes via test_anomaly_flag.
  See the ooni_verdict CASE below for the one concrete correction this
  finding produced (psiphon_failure moved from ANOMALOUS to FAILED).

  fingerprint_match_id is always NULL this phase (real fingerprint
  matching against ooni/blocking-fingerprints is Phase 5, out of scope
  here) -- the column exists now purely for forward compatibility, and
  because CONFIRMED's three-layer guard (see
  int.ooni_measurement_verdicts_confirmed_guard.sql) needs somewhere
  structurally safe to be built ahead of that real logic landing.

  STRUCTURAL GUARD (layer 1 of 3, see the confirmed_guard asset for layers
  2-3): fingerprint_match_id is populated ONLY inside wc_confirmed below,
  a CTE whose SOURCE is filtered to test_name = 'web_connectivity' --
  never by a bare `CASE WHEN test_name = 'web_connectivity'` predicate
  mixed into a shared, unfiltered CTE. OONI's CONFIRMED state is
  structurally possible only for web_connectivity (fingerprint-matched
  block pages / censorship-associated DNS answers) -- never for Signal,
  WhatsApp, Telegram, Tor, or any other test. Get this right now so
  Phase 5 has one safe, pre-isolated place to add real fingerprint-match
  logic later, rather than requiring a future author to remember to add
  the test_name filter themselves.

  probe_accuracy_gate grounds a real, earlier-measured finding (an audit
  found 80/361 BLOCKED TLS rows and 99/100 residual ssl_* UNKNOWN rows
  carry OONI's own scores.accuracy = 0.0) via
  marts.dim_ooni_probe_version_accuracy -- see that asset's header for the
  sourced discard rule (Signal-specific, ooni/probe#2344) and three
  corrections made in the original design before encoding it (compound
  version+date condition, cross-test test_version collisions, no
  engine_version field). TD-91 (2026-08-16): probe_accuracy_gate now
  gates ooni_verdict directly (see that CASE) -- confirmed the LEFT JOIN
  to dim_ooni_probe_version_accuracy already existed (the
  ADR-0001/TD-05-shaped "built but never joined" failure this session
  checked for did not recur), only the downstream *use* of its result
  was the still-open decision, resolved this session as exclude-not-flag.

  TD-101 Phase 3 (2026-08-20): dnscheck's FAILED tier is now reachable.
  Previously EVERY non-NULL dnscheck_bootstrap_failure value routed to
  ANOMALOUS in full, and FAILED was structurally unreachable for this
  test type (TD-101's own original finding). Live investigation of the
  full value distribution (9,412 non-NULL rows: dns_bogon_error 4,523,
  dns_nxdomain_error 3,120, generic_timeout_error 1,300, android_dns_
  cache_no_data 407, dns_temporary_failure 46, dns_server_misbehaving 16)
  found dns_bogon_error is the one value with a real, already-validated
  manipulation signature (TD-55: whole-session bogoning of DoH/DoT
  resolver hostnames while messaging-app DNS resolved normally on the
  same network-day, already classified BLOCKED @ 0.90 in int.ooni_
  experiment_results.sql, regression-locked by tests/test_ooni_dns_
  bogon_classification.py) -- it keeps its ANOMALOUS classification,
  unchanged. Every OTHER non-NULL value newly routes to FAILED, having
  been separately investigated and found NOT manipulation-shaped:
  dns_nxdomain_error, the second-largest at 33.1% of the total, is
  dominated by a handful of permanently-dead/typo'd DoH/DoT target
  hostnames in OONI's own dnscheck target list (doh.appliedprivacy.ne --
  almost certainly a typo for appliedprivacy.at -- 0/629 successes
  across this table's entire 2023-06-12 through 2025-03-05 ingestion
  window; draco.plan9-ns2.com and dnses.alekberg.net show the same
  100%-failure, permanently-dead signature), the same probe/test-
  infrastructure-artifact shape TD-47 Phase 1 already established for
  this test type's `lookups`-layer failures. This is a narrow carve-out,
  not a blanket rule -- an earlier design draft that would have routed
  ALL non-NULL values to FAILED was caught by advisory review before any
  code was written, precisely because it would have silently reverted
  TD-55. See the ooni_verdict CASE below for the actual predicate (self-
  contained, excludes dns_bogon_error explicitly rather than relying on
  CASE branch ordering) and reports.md for the full session account,
  including why TD-47 Phase 1/Phase 2a's answers-layer staging tables
  are deliberately not joined here. ooni_verdict_source stays
  'PARTIAL_BOOTSTRAP_ONLY' for dnscheck (no existing consumer of the
  literal's value requires changing it, confirmed by grep across
  streamlit/, Bruin/assets/marts/, Bruin/assets/features/, tests/, and
  Bruin/scripts/agreement_check/) -- the name still accurately describes
  the scope (bootstrap only, never the lookups layer), just with a
  fuller-than-before routing of that one field's real values now that
  FAILED is reachable. This fix's cascade (features.ooni_weekly_signals
  and the Streamlit National Stress Observatory page's dnscheck-
  selectable anomalous_rate series) moves dnscheck's live ANOMALOUS rate
  down materially, expected and correct, not a regression -- see
  reports.md for before/after figures. The tests/fixtures/ooni_weekly_
  golden/finance_bill_2024.json golden fixture's dnscheck ooni_verdict_
  weekly values are re-frozen in the same session, matching TD-93's own
  precedent for the exact same fixture.

  TD-91 (2026-08-16), Task D -- the NULL sentinel split. ooni_verdict
  IS NULL currently has THREE distinguishable causes, not two: (1) tor,
  by design, not implemented this phase -- ooni_verdict_source =
  'NOT_IMPLEMENTED'; (2) a known-bad-probe-version exclusion (Task B's
  new exclude-not-flag decision, signal-only today) -- probe_accuracy_gate
  = 'DISCARDED_BAD_PROBE_VERSION'; (3) a genuine, unexpected per-row
  extraction failure on an otherwise-implemented, otherwise-scored test
  type -- test_anomaly_flag hit its own defensive NULL fallback (e.g.
  signal_backend_status present but neither 'ok' nor 'blocked'). No new
  sentinel column was needed -- (1) and (2) are already fully
  distinguishable via the existing ooni_verdict_source/probe_accuracy_gate
  columns; (3) is simply "NULL and neither of the other two applies."
  The custom_checks entry below (unknown_extraction_failure_rate_is_zero)
  monitors (3) specifically, per test_name -- live rate confirmed 0 for
  every implemented+scored test type as of 2026-08-16 (signal/whatsapp/
  telegram/psiphon/dnscheck all show 0 unexplained-NULL rows; only tor's
  by-design NULLs and signal's known-bad-version exclusions exist today).
  A nonzero rate for any of those five going forward is a real alarm --
  it means a live OONI field shape changed underneath this asset's
  assumptions (e.g. a probe update introducing a new
  signal_backend_status value this CASE doesn't recognize).

  TD-105 (2026-08-21): whatsapp's test_anomaly_flag arm now uses
  whatsapp_web_accessible (stg.ooni_measurement_summary.sql) in place of
  whatsapp_web_status = 'blocked'. An eight-check verification session
  (2026-08-21) found whatsapp_web_status unreliable specifically at probe
  test_version=0.9.0 -- that probe version's own plain-HTTP check against
  http://web.whatsapp.com/ marks the whole web check "failed" whenever the
  response isn't exactly HTTP 302, regardless of whether the HTTPS leg of
  the same URL succeeded, and OONI's own backend scorer never reads this
  field at all. This produced a real, measured false-positive rate (32-
  33/33 matched pairs of this exact shape disagreed with OONI's own live
  classification) concentrated entirely in the obsolete 0.9.0 install
  base (100/100 directly-inspected raw rows carry a Meta-origin response
  signature with a null HTTPS-leg failure -- the HTTPS check succeeded
  every time). Probe 0.11.0 removes the flawed check; confirmed live that
  every 0.11.0 whatsapp_web_status='blocked' row's whatsapp_web_failure
  already matches $.requests[]'s HTTPS-leg failure field exactly (40/40
  sampled), so recomputing from raw data changes nothing for 0.11.0 and
  only reclassifies 0.9.0 rows where the HTTPS leg actually succeeded.
  This bug was confirmed dashboard-facing, not internal-only:
  features.ooni_weekly_signals -> the National Stress Observatory page's
  weekly-signal protocol selector renders whatsapp's anomalous_rate
  directly from this classification chain, live, today. Two other
  conditions in this same OR-chain were investigated in the same
  verification session: registration_server_status = 'blocked' (89%
  genuinely correct against OONI's live classification across both probe
  versions; a small, separate 2/562-row http_request_failed exception
  exists but is too small and different in kind to fold into this fix)
  was found NOT to share this shape and left untouched, while
  whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count > 0 (real, 1,042 rows, but
  heterogeneous -- a small oracle check split ~50/50 against OONI's own
  judgment) was flagged as needing its own dedicated investigation.

  TD-105 build (2026-08-22): that dedicated investigation happened (two
  follow-up sessions, 2026-08-21 and 2026-08-22) and found
  whatsapp_endpoints_blocked_count > 0 actively wrong, not just
  imprecise -- OONI's own live scorer disables this exact rule in its
  source ("Disabled due to bug in the probe
  https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/issues/341"), and restricted to
  the population where blocked_count was the ONLY driver, OONI agreed
  with CLIO's ANOMALOUS call 0/131 times across two independent samples.
  Removed from the OR-chain entirely (not thresholded), along with the
  permanently-dead whatsapp_endpoints_dns_inconsistent_count > 0 -- see
  that arm's own inline comment below for the full mechanism (branch
  precedence: OONI's endpoint-accessibility check is only ever reached
  after web/registration checks already pass). See reports.md's
  2026-08-21 and 2026-08-22 TD-105 session entries (verification and
  build) for the full account.

  TD-126 (2026-08-30, characterization then same-day build): whatsapp's
  test_anomaly_flag arm's third disjunct now uses whatsapp_registration_
  accessible (stg.ooni_measurement_summary.sql) in place of registration_
  server_status = 'blocked' -- the fix bug (c) above was flagged for
  (2026-08-21) but never given, until a 2026-08-30 characterization
  session (triggered by the TD-100/ADR-0013 agreement-check harness
  surfacing exactly this shape via its rotating sample) found it shares
  bug (a)/(b)'s exact mechanism: OONI's own backend fastpath scorer
  explicitly disables reading registration_server_status, citing the same
  probe bug already cited for bug (b) (ooni/probe-engine#341), and
  recomputes accessibility from $.requests[]'s own
  https://v.whatsapp.net/v2/register entry's failure field instead. Of
  278 registration_server_status='blocked' sole-driver rows, exactly 2
  have a genuinely non-null request failure (both a real HTTP 503 from
  v.whatsapp.net -- transport succeeded, only the probe's own
  higher-level status field disagreed); the other 276 are unaffected,
  consistent with the 89%-genuinely-correct figure already measured for
  this field. See stg.ooni_measurement_summary.sql's own header and
  reports.md's 2026-08-30 TD-126 session entries (characterization and
  build) for the full account, including OONI's own scorer source
  hand-applied to both affected measurements and confirmed to exactly
  reproduce OONI's live OK answer.

  TD-102 (2026-08-22, characterization through build sessions):
  probe_accuracy_gate now also discards signal test_version=0.2.3 rows
  dated after OONI's own one-time November 2023 data-quality mutation
  (measurement_start_time > 2023-11-06T16:00:00 -- see that CASE's own
  inline comment for the full account and the exhaustive/near-exhaustive
  verification behind it) -- a SEPARATE mechanism from signal
  test_version=0.2.2's own, unrelated defect (a dead
  api.directory.signal.org backend target). 0.2.2's fix started as a
  version-wide dim_ooni_probe_version_accuracy discard in the first
  build session, then was RESCOPED (same day, second build session)
  to an inline signal_backend_status='blocked' predicate here instead,
  once that first session's own post-fix validation found the
  "poisons every measurement" premise did not hold against the real
  population (only 415/2,200 rows, 18.9%, actually show
  signal_backend_status='blocked'; the other 1,785 are genuine,
  OONI-agreed 'ok' rows that should not be discarded). Do not conflate
  any of these three mechanisms: 0.2.0 (dim table, genuinely
  unconditional, OONI-confirmed version-wide) vs. 0.2.2 (inline,
  status-gated, ~19% of the version) vs. 0.2.3 (inline, date-gated).
  All three resolve to the same DISCARDED_BAD_PROBE_VERSION outcome
  and precedence tier, deliberately -- see reports.md's 2026-08-22
  TD-102 session entries (characterization, first build, rescoping
  build).
