safe_materialize.py
===================
Cascade-safe materialization wrapper for the Bruin/BigQuery DAG (ADR-0012).

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
----------------------
ADR-0005's staleness check detects downstream tables built from upstream
state that has since changed. It detects; it does not prevent. On
2026-08-16 it fired with 6 new violations because a fix session the day
before rematerialized two upstream assets and rebuilt nothing below them --
the same partial-cascade shape ADR-0005 was written for (TD-38, TD-40,
TD-54), reintroduced by hand.

The failure was not cadence (the pipeline is not run often enough); it was
completeness inside one session. This wrapper closes that gap
mechanically:

    1. always `bruin run --downstream <asset>` -- never a bare
       single-asset run, so the cascade is not a thing a person or an
       agent has to remember;
    2. run the ADR-0005 staleness check in the same invocation, so the
       verdict arrives in the same minute rather than in tomorrow's
       06:00 UTC CI email.

This script is the only sanctioned way to materialize anything in this
repository. The daily CI staleness workflow stays exactly as it is, as a
backstop for anything that bypasses this script (a bare `bruin run`, a
direct `bq` DDL, a dashboard-side edit).

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO
----------------------------
It does not prove correctness. The staleness check compares timestamps,
never contents (ADR-0005's own closing limitation). A green run here means
"everything declared-downstream was rebuilt after its upstream" -- not
"the numbers are right." Quality checks (`bruin run` executes `main` and
`checks` by default) and `pytest` remain separate obligations.

It also cannot cascade through intelligence.acled_pressure_regimes. That
asset is `strategy: merge` under an EXECUTION CONTRACT of exactly one
country x one new week x one execution, and its upstream precondition
check (intelligence.acled_pressure_regimes_precondition_check) calls
ERROR() when more than one week is in scope -- which is every run that
uses pipeline.yml's default `target_week=""`. A cascade that reaches it
therefore aborts there and leaves everything below it unbuilt. This
script refuses up front instead of discovering that mid-cascade; see
--allow-contract-bound and the remediation text it prints.

Verified live 2026-08-16 (ADR-0012 build session) against bruin
v0.11.664: `bruin run assets/intelligence/acled_pressure_regimes_precondition.sql`
with no --var override (default target_week="") fails exactly as
predicted -- "Found 1523 distinct week_start_date value(s) for
target_week=<unset>" -- confirming this refusal is not theoretical.

EXIT CODES
----------
    0  cascade succeeded and the staleness check passed
    1  staleness check reported NEW (non-allowlisted) violations
    2  staleness check hit an operational error (bruin/BigQuery/allowlist)
    3  refused before running anything (contract-bound asset in scope,
       or a usage/resolution error)
    4  `bruin run` failed; the staleness check was still run and its
       findings printed, but the run itself did not complete
